# Programming tips

This repository contains several somewhat arbitrary programming hints for C++.
Most examples require C++14, which is properly [supported][1] by most
compilers.

Just have a look at the source code in `src`. You don't have to build it,
but if you want, run something like:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	cmake --build .

Reading the source is nice, but you learn more if you try it yourself.
